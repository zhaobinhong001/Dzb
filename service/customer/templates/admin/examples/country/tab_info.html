    <th>Tabs</th>
    <td>
      Tabs you see above are based on mostly CSS/JS solution, therefore integration of tabs is simple and non intrusive - all your form handling will work the same as before.
      <br><br>
      Tabs can contain fieldsets, inlines and custom/included templates

    <th>Includes</th>
    <td>
      Django Suit provides handy shortcut to include templates into forms, into several positions:
      <ul>
        <li>top - above fieldsets</li>
        <li>middle - between fieldsets and inlines</li>
        <li>bottom - after inlines</li>
      </ul>
      Suit includes are nothing but a shortcut. The same can be achieved by extending change_form.html and hooking into particular blocks. Suit includes can be used in combination with or without tabs.
